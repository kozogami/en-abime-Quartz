A somewhat eerie transcript wherein an assailant attempts to cajole two victims into a procedure that would "unravel them" but apparently prolong the assailant's existence, or give it new meaning. The assailant has veeery similar mannerisms to William, and we have our suspicions that we know who the two victims are, but I'll leave the theory craft at that for now.
