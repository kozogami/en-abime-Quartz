"Everyone gets in different. Sometimes it’s close to where you are, sometimes it’s farther. The hike is worth it, I swear! Half the time I don’t even know what I’m doing! I ain’t got a clue how I got here! Half the time when I meet you it’s in something totally new to me. Ya think I knew what a radio was before I got there? A goddamn server? When did they build that new thing across the street? Count the radio channels in your car. Did you open that tab on your phone? Is your TV on? Go towards it."

Welcome to The Abyss, my friends. Here we will hope and strive to not miss the forest for the trees, and build our branching garden path together to navigate its manifold mysteries.
